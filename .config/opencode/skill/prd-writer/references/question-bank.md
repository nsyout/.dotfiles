# Clarification Question Bank

Use these to run the mandatory clarification-first conversation.

## Problem and Outcome

- What user pain is most urgent, and what evidence supports it?
- What changes for users if this succeeds in 90 days?
- What happens if we do nothing this quarter?

## Users and Stakeholders

- Who is the primary user, and who is explicitly not a target user?
- Which teams must approve or operate this capability?
- Who owns final sign-off for scope and success metrics?

## Scope Boundaries

- What must be in v1 for this to be considered useful?
- What tempting additions should be explicitly out of scope?
- Are there existing workflows this must not disrupt?

## Constraints

- Are there platform, security, legal, or compliance constraints?
- What timeline constraints are fixed vs negotiable?
- What staffing or ownership constraints affect feasibility?

## Requirements Quality

- Which requirements are strict "must" vs optional "nice-to-have"?
- How will each key requirement be verified in testing?
- What edge cases would make this fail in production?

## Metrics and Risk

- What baseline metrics exist today?
- What target values define success, and by when?
- What are the top 2-3 risks and fallback plans?

## Dependency and Rollout

- What external systems/teams block launch?
- What is the minimum safe rollout sequence?
- What readiness checks are required before wider rollout?

## Contradiction Probes

- I see conflicting inputs on [X]. Which source is authoritative?
- Notes say [A], but doc says [B]. Which should the PRD follow?
- Should we record [A/B] as assumption pending decision?

## Compact Starter Set (Default 6)

1. Who is the primary user and core problem?
2. What is in scope for v1, and what is explicitly out?
3. What constraints are non-negotiable (technical/org/timeline)?
4. What acceptance criteria would prove this works?
5. What success metrics and target windows matter most?
6. Which dependencies or external approvals could block rollout?
